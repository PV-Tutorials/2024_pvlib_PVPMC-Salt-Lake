# pvlib hackathon at PVPMC 2024
![alt text](_static/PVLib_PVPMCLogo.png)

The pvlib community is looking forward to another pvlib hackathon at the [2024 PV Performance Modeling Workshop](https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/workshops-and-pubs/workshops/) in Salt Lake City. The format this year will be similar to last year—less like a two-hour lecture and more like “choose your own adventure”. During the session, you will choose a topic to explore using pvlib, and other members of the community will be available to help you get started and provide guidance.

If you’re just getting started with pvlib, fret not, we have a list of suggested topics below you can work on. If anything is unclear, feel free to comment on the individual project ideas. More information on each project can be found by following the links below.

## Practical information
You do not need to have prior programming experience or Python installed (we'll be using the Google Colab online programming environment). To get you started, there will be a very brief introduction to python and pvlib (~10 min), after which you will be ready to tackle your project.

The session will take place on Thursday, May 9 from 1:25 to 3:25 pm.
